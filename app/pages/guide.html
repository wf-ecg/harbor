                            <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
                            <p> Our objective at Harbor Risk is to make your job as simple as we can while providing the best possible protection and pricing for your clients.
                                By following the helpful tips below, our service to you will be timely and mutually rewarding for everyone involved.
                                Of course, if you have any questions, please contact us at any time.</p>

                            <h4> Include a cover letter</h4>
                            <p> A cover letter with additional details helps us tailor our coverage to more precisely meet your client’s needs.
                                The more information you can provide, the more accurate our quote can be. Examples of information to include: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Your opinion on the condition of the buildings, equipment and docks</li>
                                <li> A description of how the inventory is stored and the methods for securing it</li>
                                <li> A summary of the client’s philosophy on employee safety and programs in place (employee manual, safety training program, etc.)</li>
                                <li> Anything else that will provide further insight into the client’s needs</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Send pictures</h4>
                            <p> Photos are an excellent way to quickly provide specific details about the account. Consider sending along photos to illustrate:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Condition of the docks</li>
                                <li> Lifting equipment such as travel lifts, fork trucks and cranes</li>
                                <li> Areas of interest related to fueling, food &amp; beverage etc…</li>
                                <li> Interior of the shop area including fireproof cabinets, eye wash stations, tool storage, etc.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>ACORD applications</h4>
                            <p> Fully completed ACORD applications allow us to quote more accurately and bind in a timely fashion.</p>

                            <h4>Harbor Risk supplemental application</h4>
                            <p> Our supplemental application keeps it simple.
                                It takes into consideration the limited amount of time an agent has with his or her client and the supplemental application is self-explanatory.
                                Even if you are not intimately familiar with marina operations, you can deliver the relevant information to obtain a quote for your client.</p>

                            <h4>Loss runs</h4>
                            <p> We request five years of loss runs (hard copy) for all lines requested.</p>
